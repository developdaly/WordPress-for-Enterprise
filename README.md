WordPress for Enterprise
========================

As this document is just getting started I'd like the WordPress community to contribute its best, most factually backed reasons why WordPress *can* and be used by large companies.

## History

WordPress, originally known as "b2 cafelog", was started in 2001 before Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little forked the software to create WordPress. As its onset, WordPress was a personal published platform: blogging software. Through its maturity, and most notable with the release of version 3.0 in 2010, WordPress is now considered a content management system. [[wphistory]]

> A content management system (CMS) is a computer program that allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as maintenance from a central interface. Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment. These procedures can be manual steps or an automated cascade. [[wikicms]]
